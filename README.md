# EducationAssistant
My final year project aims to help self-learners who use internet as their active source of knowledge. The project is expected to have 3 main modules namely:
<br>*Summarising
<br>*Question answering
<br>*Integration of all learning platforms

## Summarising:
This part focuses on scraping top google results for the user query and summarising them for easy skimming over large contents.
## Question answering:
It is a model that helps in identifying the answer to a question or doubt posed by the user. Inorder to do this, the system returns top results for the subjects(finds by PoS tagging) in the user query and searches for the best anwer from the documents retrieved. The question answering model can be trained with Stanford Question Answering dataset.
## Integration of all learning platforms
The idea is to bring in all the active courses in various MOOC platforms. This helps the users in keeping track of their active courses and divide them time accordingly.
